## Recommendations and Reporting Phase

### Recommendations
1. **Improve App Performance:** Address lag and stability issues. The app consistently stutters and buffers between actions.
3. **Redesign Restaurant Info:** Make hours/locations clearer. I suggest displaying the hours, even while the restaurant is closed to improve clarity of when they are open. 
4. **Streamline Ordering:** Reduce steps and improve confidence. I suggest that after adding a item to your cart, the app automatically opens the full menu.
